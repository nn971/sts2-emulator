# Nature issue #143: playable controlled-chance integration

**Tracking issue:** [#143](https://github.com/nn971/sts2-emulator/issues/143).
**Base:** the isolated fidelity/RNG integration branch (PR [#137](https://github.com/nn971/sts2-emulator/pull/137)); the Silent all-Act gameplay snapshot in `main` is unchanged.
**Status:** partial interface implementation. Issue #143 stays open until the playable control criteria are met.

## Delivered by the event-metadata slice

- `hello.natureEventMetadataSchemaId = sts2-v111-nature-event-metadata-v1`; existing `natureBoundarySchemaId` and `natureBoundaryScope=isolated-combat-entry-only` remain unchanged.
- `hello.naturePlayable = false` explicitly prevents interpreting an isolated `natureHandle` as an executable `stateHandle`.
- `nature_inspect(nature_handle)` returns source site, stream, owner, occurrence ordinal, source version, operation kind, ordered candidate IDs or bounded count, support size/fingerprint, stable event ID, ordered previous choices, and `probabilityStatus=UNVERIFIED`. It exposes neither hidden exact state nor native RNG cursor; full trusted state remains available only through opt-in snapshot calls.
- Event identity is computed from the pinned source request and ordered prior selected indices, independent of session handle allocation and worker scheduling. After a successful `nature_resolve`, the previous pending event becomes the final element of the replay transcript. HP→intent composition retains the HP prefix.
- Python `NatureBoundary.inspect()` exposes the same read-only interface with capability negotiation.
- Focused C# tests exercise candidate metadata, snapshot/fork identity, ordered HP→intent provenance, detached view arrays, and deterministic 15-worker isolated fixture execution.

### Example request

```json
{"op":"nature_inspect","nature_handle":"n1"}
```

The response includes `schemaId`, `kind`, `mode`, `natureHandle`, `fingerprint`, `complete`, `pending` and `transcript`. The `pending` object is null after every isolated choice is resolved. Outcome selection remains `nature_resolve(nature_handle, fingerprint, selected_index)`, validating the full state fingerprint before publishing the child.

## Remaining issue acceptance gates

| Gate | Status | Work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G0: playable controlled RunState + fair observation | **BLOCKED** | Author a real combat-entry suspension with intact player deck, opening turn, native entity IDs, and no pre-consumed chance choice. An isolated `CombatState` cannot safely be promoted to a fake playable `RunState`. |
| G1: mechanically resumed action→chance→action | **BLOCKED** | Suspend an in-flight engine continuation at chance requests. Resume within the same ordered hook transaction without replaying earlier side effects. |
| G2: live chance-site coverage | **BLOCKED** | Migrate formation, opening shuffle/draw, later draws/reshuffles, random targeting and auto-play, summons, death, nested triggers; stop with site/operation on uncovered draws. |
| G3: extended chance operations | **PARTIAL** | `choose_index` and compact `bounded_integer` exist. Other source-shaped operation types need requests and execution integration. |
| G4: stable event IDs and transcript | **PARTIAL, this change** | Isolated HP→intent events have typed provenance. In-flight gameplay events must be added when G1 exists. |
| G5: fair player boundary | **BLOCKED** | `prototype-fair-v0` belongs to playable `stateHandle`; no controlled playable handles exist yet. The new `nature_inspect` is intentionally Nature-facing. |
| G6: 15-worker isolation | **PARTIAL, this change** | Deterministic isolated fixture tests only; real concurrent controlled combat rollouts and throughput remain to implement. |
| G7: conditional native chance law | **DEFERRED** | Explicitly `UNVERIFIED`; source law and importance-sampling weights require separate calibration. |

## Engineering sequencing

1. Use the existing source-shaped HP→intent provider and `RandomBoundaryJournalV111` as the internal event codec.
2. Integrate the provider at **real** combat entry, including formation and shuffle, with a persisted `RunState` continuation. Keep existing native `step` unaffected.
3. Implement repeated chance suspension/resume and strict failure for uncovered RNG calls.
4. Expose a new `controlledChanceSchemaId` **only after** playable controlled game states, fair player actions and exact snapshot continuation are tested.
5. Add joint player/chance replay, targeted special encounters, 15-worker end-to-end stress and eventually calibrated native chance laws.

**Compatibility:** `sts2-v111-nature-isolated-boundary-v1` is unchanged. No native seeded RNG cursor is claimed to match counterfactual controlled outcomes. The proposed [desired RNG implementation](DESIRED_RNG_IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [Inspector plan](NATIVE_FIDELITY_INSPECTOR_PLAN.md) are unchanged.
